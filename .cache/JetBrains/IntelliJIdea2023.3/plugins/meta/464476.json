{"id":464476,"xmlId":"com.intellij.ml.llm","name":"AI Assistant","description":"\n  AI Assistant provides AI-powered features for software development based on the JetBrains AI service. The service transparently connects you, as an IDE user, to different large language models (LLMs). At the moment the service supports OpenAI and additionally hosts a number of smaller models created by JetBrains. In the future, we plan to extend this to more providers, giving our users access to the best options and models available.\n  <br><br>\n  The plugin is in the technical preview stage with <b>limited access</b> to the functionality. We are working on making the feature available for everyone, but considering the nature of the product, its current state and cost we are not able to do that yet.\n  <br><br>\n  Currently all available spots are exhausted and we are unable to provide estimates on when access will be provided. Please use this <a href=\"https://auth.grazie.ai/invite/C3SqGSRWWiDsKx8VOalfqOWFzRinqWq6YLwhf1MBqJIFOqIcJEaYPwaS1toLaLkyZGylI6nqD8jEcjWnaa8vhErQxviP8GnnQntkInvvODBba4voRQKXYHxenrIRnrpW\">link</a> if you’d like to join the waiting list. You’ll receive an email with an invitation as soon as you get access to the functionality. Please take into account that installing the plugin isn't necessary until you get access.\n  <br><br>\n  With AI Assistant, you can:\n  <ol>\n    <li>use the <i>AI Assistant</i> chat tool window to have a conversation with the LLM, ask questions, or iterate on a task. The IDE will provide some project-specific context, such as the languages and technologies used in your project. Once you’re happy with the result, use the <i>Insert Snippet at Caret</i> function to put the AI-generated code into the editor, or just copy it over.</li>\n    <li>ask the AI about a specific code fragment, select it in the editor and invoke an action from the <i>AI Actions</i> menu (available in the editor context menu or by using the Alt+Enter shortcut).</li>\n    <li>generate the documentation for a declaration, call up the <i>AI Actions</i> menu and select <i>Generate documentation</i> action. This is currently supported for Java, Kotlin, and Python.</li>\n    <li>generate a commit message. The commit message dialog now has a <i>Generate Commit Message with AI Assistant</i> button. Click it to send the diffs of your changes to the LLM, which will generate a commit message describing your changes.</li>\n    <li>rename a Java, Kotlin, or Python declaration, the AI will suggest name options for the declaration, based on its contents. This can be turned off in <i>Settings | Tools | AI Assistant</i>.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <b>Notes:</b><br>\n  To access the AI features, you’ll need to be logged in to the JetBrains AI service with your JetBrains Account. You can log in from the <i>AI Assistant</i> tool window or from <i>Settings | Tools | AI Assistant</i>.\n  <br><br>\n  The JetBrains AI service may not be available for everyone immediately. We let a certain number of users in. Once the maximum capacity is reached, the rest will be joining the waitlist. We’ll be gradually inviting more people to try the product.\n  <br>\n  Access to the AI service is currently restricted to the territories where the OpenAI service is available. You can check the full list of territories <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/terms/jetbrains-ai/service-territory/\">here</a>.\n  <br><br>\n  You can report issues and leave feature requests in the <a href=\"https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/LLM\">AI Assistant issue tracker</a>.\n  ","organization":"JetBrains s.r.o.","tags":["Code Tools","Editor","Productivity","Machine Learning","Freemium"],"vendor":"JetBrains","version":"233.13135.116","dependencies":["Git4Idea","com.intellij.modules.ultimate"],"optionalDependencies":["intellij.devkit.core","org.jetbrains.plugins.go","com.intellij.java","intellij.ml.llm.java","org.jetbrains.kotlin","com.intellij.modules.python","intellij.ml.llm.python","Pythonid","intellij.jupyter","com.intellij.modules.clion","JavaScript","org.jetbrains.android","intellij.platform.ml.embeddings","org.jetbrains.plugins.ruby","com.jetbrains.php","com.jetbrains.performancePlugin","org.intellij.plugins.markdown","intellij.aqua.wi","intellij.aqua.frameworks.core"],"since":"233.13135","until":"233.13135.*","size":6601617,"productCode":"AIP"}
